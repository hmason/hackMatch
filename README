hackMatch
=========

hackMatch is an open-source matching algorithm. It accepts two sets of text and finds the best matches between each.

For example, at hackNY.org we use hackMatch to match students with appropriate internship opportunities.

This script is open source, and patches are welcome.

Dependencies

hackMatch uses NLTK (nltk.org) and hcluster (for distance metrics).
